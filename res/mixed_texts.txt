The Resurrection of Jesus Christ is the foundation of the Christian faith.
Without the resurrection, the belief in God's saving grace through Jesus is destroyed.
When Jesus rose from the dead, he confirmed his identity as the Son of God and his work of atonement, redemption, reconciliation, and salvation.
The Resurrection was a literal, physical raising of Jesus body from the dead.
Jesus was arrested, tried, and found guilty of claiming to be a king.
Jesus body was hung on a cross between two thieves.
After his death, Jesus body was wrapped in linen cloth and placed in a tomb with a large stone rolled across the opening.
On the third day, an early Sunday morning, Mary Magdalene, mother of Jesus, and another Mary came to the tomb and found it empty, Jesus was disappeared.
Sitting on the rolled-away stone was an angel of the Lord who told them not to be afraid because Jesus had risen.
As the women left to tell the disciples, Jesus Christ met them and showed them his nail-pierced hands.
The Old and the New Testaments speak of the truth of Jesus being raised from death - Jesus testified of his resurrection before He died on the cross, and his disciples witnessed his body after the resurrection.
Below are the Bible verses and Scriptures that both prophesize the resurrection of Jesus and testify of the reality of the resurrected body of Christ.

 A spectre is haunting Europe, the spectre of communism.
 All the powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.
 Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries? Two things result from this fact: Communism is already acknowledged by all European powers to be itself a power, It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the  spectre of communism with a manifesto of the party itself.
 To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.
